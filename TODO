Can we have an google sheet or excel file every week that accompanies the report, and that people can dig into in terms of individual deals?  I think Mark may have produced something for the US/CA team last week as a one-off, but it'd be worth it to show everyone at the New Biz meeting and make sure we get exactly what they want
Can we show more of a "W/W change" in the report?
Can we add deals that have recently gone live?
Can we create a folder to store these requests?
